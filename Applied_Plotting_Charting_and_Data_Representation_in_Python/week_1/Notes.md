# First Week Notes

## Visualization Wheel

A plot can be weather complex and deep or intelligeble and shallow.

There are many factors to consider which make it tend to one way or the other:

* **Abstraction vs Figuration**
  * Boxes and chars (abstractions) or real-world physical objects (figuration);
* **Functionality vs Decoration**
  * No embellishments (functionaly) or artistic embellishments (decoration);
* **Density vs Lightness**
  * Must be studied in depth (density) or understandable at a glance
    (lightness);
* **Multidimensional vs Unidimensional**
  * different aspects of phenomena (multidimensional) or single or few items of
    phenomena (unidimensional);
* **Originality vs Familiarity**
  * Novel methods of visualization (originality) or established and well
    understood methods of visualization (familiarity);
* **Novelty vs Redundancy**
  * Explaining each item once (novelty) or encoding multiple explanations of the
    same phenomena (redundancy);

## Graphical heuristics

### Data-ink ratio

Edward Tufte defines *data-ink* as the non-redundant ink arranged in responde to
variation in the numbers represented. It's the non-erasable core of a graphic.

He defined the *data-ink ratio* as the total amoung of data-ink divided by the
amoung of total ink required to print the graphic. In other words, it's a
measurement for the percentage of core displayed information against the rest in
out graphic. Therefore, it sugests that we remove those elements which don't add
new information and keep it simple.

### Chart junk

Chart junk is a special kind of non-data ink that Tufte recommends avoiding the
maximum you can. He sugests that artistic decorations on statistical graphs are
like weeds in it. He defined three kinds of chart junks:

* **Unintended optical art** like excessive shading or patterning of chart
  features. Patterns can make the human eye jump and causa visual fatigue.
* **Grids** are unecessary and causes competition with the actual data being
  shared. Thinning, removing, or desaturating grid lines makes it easier to see
  the data, istead of being overwhelmed by the number of lines on the page.
* The last chartjunk is named by Tufte as **the duck** and he refers to it as
  non-data creative graphics, whether they be line art or photographs included
  in the chart.

Direct labeling the data is a great way to reduce both unintended optical art
and grids.

The third chartjunk is actually the one that should come in mind when we say
chartjunk. But there's a real discution about whether it's good or not to be
included in our graphs. On the one hand, the duck makes our graphics not precise
and formal, but on the other hand, it makes them memorable, which might be a
desired quality.

### Spark Lines

Spark Lines are the really simple graphs with no labels, legends, or lots of
colors. They are intended to complement a text and make it more visual,
embedded in the text or tables.

### Lie Factors

Lie Factors must ever be avoided. They are factors in our graphs that might
confuse the reader and even get wrong perceptions about the data.

One example of lie factor is a graph with non-linear spaced percentages,
making the slope from 1% to 2% higher than from 5% to 15%, for instance.

Another example would be grouping having a bar graph comparting the profit of a
company during 1993-1996 and 1999-2003 (period of 3 and 4 years and not ajusting
the inflation).

## The qualities of an information graphic

Albert Cairo defines five main qualities that every graphic must have. They're
not independent of one another.

1. **Truthful**
    * Be aware of your actions when cleaning, summarizing and mainupulating data
      and ensure you aren't
        * Mistleading yourself (self deception)
        * Misleading your audience
1. **Functionality**
1. **Beauty**
1. **Insightful**
1. **Enlightening**
    * A combination of the previous four, but with a social ethical
      responsibility.
