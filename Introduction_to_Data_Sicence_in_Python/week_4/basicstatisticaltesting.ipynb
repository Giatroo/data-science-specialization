    "In hypothesis testing, we have two statements of interest: the first is our actual explanation, which we call the alternative hypothesis, and the second is that the explanation we have is not sufficient, and we call this the null hypothesis. Our actual testing method is to determine whether the null hypothesis is true or not. If we find that there's a difference between groups, then we can reject the null hypothesis and we accept our alternative."

Let's take a look at those p-values for a moment though, beucase they are saying thing that can inform experimental design down the road. For instance, one of the assignements, assignemtn 3, has a p-value around 0.1. This means that if we accepted a level of chance similarity of 11% this would have been considered statistically significant. As a research, this would suggest to me that there is something here worth considering following up on.
